1.         What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?

 So far what was completed was creating a cart and using cookies and session for my webpage, It was also planned to tweak up the page to make it look more pleasing to the eye. There was some other problem that occured in assignment two that was needed to be fix and improved, such as improving and fixing up login and registration  

2.         Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
I beleive that some bugs or problem might be some login issue and email being sent out correctly, I also felt that I wasn't able to to improve on the UI as much as I wanted to and improve the website looks. 
 

3.         What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?
The biggest project risk was being not starting cookies and session earlier, I had trouble implement them into my webpage and I had to ask my peers for assistances. The biggest risk I took was trying to complete the UI first before coding the cookies and session, I realise that it took to much of my time and it was unnecessary, I realize this a bit sooner and start to work on cookies and session with a reasonable amount of days before due date.
