For my first BrowserHistoy, I only skim through the screencast solution and try to understand how WODs would work. After that I would close the screencast an try my first attempt. My first attempt I did okay as I followed the instruction and do the best from my memories of building a html page. I beleive I encounter my frist problem when customizing the img size, I have already knew about inputing the img with <img src="">, but i did not know how to customized the width and height, at this time I had't pass the time limit and stopped. After the first attempt I read through the instructions and find those step that I find complicated and research and refer back to the notes to understand them deeper.my second attempt I have sucessfully pass the img tag, but unfortunately blank out when doing <li> and <a href> tags and ran out of time. I review the notes again and at this point I have chosen to review the screencast and understand each line and successfully completed the WOD on my third attempt. For browserhistory2, I felt more confortable with this WOD as it is short and I found minor issues. My first attempt was okay as I remember from lecture and the notes about linking .css to .html the only part I got stuck on was the font family. I reviewed the notes and did a bit more research and finish the wod quickly on my second attempt. As i became a little bit more familiized with .css my browserhistory 3 was a little bit complicated as I refer a lot from the screencast but I understand the process of div class and id and applying them to .css and customizing them. I would usally follow the screencast step by step and attempt to customize my own way to find a deeper understanding of the function. I completed this WOD on my second attempt. Overall, the WODs have really help me understand each function and piece together each backbones of tags to create one page, I remember more by doing these WODs.
