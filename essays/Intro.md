Hello everyone! my name is Jonathan Kan and I was born and raised on Oahu. I have chosen MIS as my major due to the high interest of technology and how useful it can be. My childhood consists of exploring the internet and video games, As years went on I found myself more fascinated with the computers. During high school, I have taken any class that would involve computer technology examples of STEM, Computer Art, and Creative media.
